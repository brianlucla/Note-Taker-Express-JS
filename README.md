# Note-Taker-Express-JS
Using Express.js to create a back end server to retrieve and save data from a JSON file

## Description

I build this project to create a user friendly note taker that stores info in the back end and posts it to the front end. This project allows us to retrieve info from the server and display it onto the html webpage. This project will help users keep track of daily tasks that they may need to remember later. In this project, I learned how to use express and node, as well as how to use them with the front end.

## Installation

Simply access the webpage through Heroku, and begin note taking!

## Usage

To run the files yourself, run "npm i" in the directory containing the Develop folder through command line. Then, run node server.js to start the server. Afterwards, you will be able to run all the methods you need.

I don't really have anything to show unfortunately.
